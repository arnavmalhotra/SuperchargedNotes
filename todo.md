allow users to open notes individually, and edit them etc
show a nicer preview on the dashboard
update the sidebar Notes to show all notes (categories if there are), maybe even create categories of notes and allow the users to tag them.
when you upload multiple files, allow the user to group them, files that are grouped together will have their output to the same markdown file.
